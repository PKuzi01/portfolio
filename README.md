## Welcome to my portfolio.
### Built by me, Philisizwe Kuzwayo. 💚

This is what it says, a portfoilio. 
Its job is to do well in exhibiting all of my work.
It is also my biggest and dearest project.
This is built using React, because it's the foundation to what I want my tech stack to be centralised on.
It is current at what I believe, will be the start f something really cool.
The more I learn, the more developed it will be. 
But for now, voila.

#### Technologies and tools used: 🎮
* React.js
* Bootstrap
* Visual Studio Code
* Git/Github

#### Table of Contents: ⭐
* Hero: it introduces me. Quite literally.
* About: an accordion menu that gives you a few tidbits about me.
* Portfolio: This shows what I'm most proud of so far. It'll evolve, of course.
* Contact: How you can reach me. You can, just by the way.
