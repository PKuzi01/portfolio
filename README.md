I've been putting this off for a long while, but I think I'm biting the bullet. And taking it well too. I'm excited. I'm reminding myself of two things: first, that done is better than perfect, and second, to keep it simple. Hopefully, the finished product will be something I'll be happy about, and it'll make it easier for me to work. A pat on the back for me.

Before you judge me about the time gap, I was busy with another project, and the had an existetial crisis about this one. The important part is that I got started. For today, I added in what I think will be the HTML for the entire thing. I plan on tackling a bit of the CSS tomorrow, so that if/when I add the JS, I can see what it is that I'd like to add behaviours to, but I don't think I'll be using JavaScript for this project. I'm glad that I got started though. Truly. It feels good to shake off the anxiety by doing the actual work.

I started on the CSS. And got suuuuuper stuck. I had to start all over. I needed to figure out how the cascade was flowing, whether my documents were the problem. I still don't know what it was, but I know using specific properties was part of the problem, and I needed to be careful to replicate my desired result. I had to read the Bootstrap documentation, and search on StackOverflow too. I haven't used Bootstrap in so long, I had forgotten how manipulate my way through it. But we're slowly making a comeback. Several hours of debugging but we're back at it.

I worked on this on Sunday as well, and I tackled the accordion. A lot of exposure to SVG and figuring out the Bootstrap styling. I think it took 5 hours to carefully see the stack work and I have to say, I'm very happy I took that time. I still have to figure out how to keep the first entry in the accordion closed instead of collapsed, but I made it look really cool. Also I love how the colour palette is playing out on this website! I love it so so so much, it means so much that I spent the time picking out the colours. Wonderful. Today, I worked on the contact and footer sections, because I'm partially scared of starting with the portfolio section. But to curb that fear, I'm gonna plan out which projects I want on there, the copy for each of the project's descriptions, and then finding good pictures to show them, that's if I use images. I might turn them into links so that I don't los ethe visual evidence. Hopefully, that eases my anxiety about it, then the styling become a lot easier. Also, I enjoy doingthe responsive work a lot, because when I open up the webiste on my phone, the translation is so seamless. I love getting the practice in. Good day's work.

#### 5 July 2023
Okay, I got over the anxiety. I think I've decided on a way to link the project for my portfolio. I have to run through the webpage a few times, both on my laptop and on my phone. Then I have to get a few people to look through it and see how it works out. I should be done with it at the end of the week, and from there, I'm focussing on adding projects to the portfolio itself. I'm really happy at how it turned out. And I really love the colour palette. Th next part is to work on making the code cleaner and easier to read, especially the CSS file. A lot of the code is repeated, so I need find a way around that. Otherwise, a good day's work.

#### 7 July 2023
I've completed my first ever portfolio! I did some minor fixes, and tried to reduce the repeated code in the stylesheet, added some stuff, like a back to top button, and finally completed the navbar (i honestly forgot about it until I tested in on my phone). I like how it came together, I'm content. Now it's just to build new projects to add, and then this time next year, I'm thinking about a new portfolio, because by then, I should have a new arsenal of skills to make an even better one! Good work, well done.
