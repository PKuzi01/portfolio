I've been putting this off for a long while, but I think I'm biting the bullet. And taking it well too. I'm excited. I'm reminding myself of two things: first, that done is better than perfect, and second, to keep it simple. Hopefully, the finished product will be something I'll be happy about, and it'll make it easier for me to work. A pat on the back for me.

Before you judge me about the time gap, I was busy with another project, and the had an existetial crisis about this one. The important part is that I got started. For today, I added in what I think will be the HTML for the entire thing. I plan on tackling a bit of the CSS tomorrow, so that if/when I add the JS, I can see what it is that I'd like to add behaviours to, but I don't think I'll be using JavaScript for this project. I'm glad that I got started though. Truly. It feels good to shake off the anxiety by doing the actual work.
